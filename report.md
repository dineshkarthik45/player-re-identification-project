# Player Re-Identification Report

## Approach and Methodology
Describe your overall approach for player re-identification in a single video feed. Explain how you use the YOLOv11 detector and your tracking logic to maintain consistent player IDs.

## Techniques Tried and Outcomes
List any techniques you experimented with (e.g., bounding box overlap, color histograms, appearance features) and discuss their effectiveness.

## Challenges Encountered
Describe any difficulties you faced (e.g., occlusion, similar player appearance, fast motion) and how you addressed or would address them.

## Incomplete Parts and Future Work
If the solution is incomplete, describe what remains and how you would proceed with more time or resources.
